# Human-Facial-Emotion-recognition-with-pulse-detection-using-CNN
The main aim of this project is to predict the emotions of the human face and also detect the Pulse Rate using webcam.            
Pulse Rate is an important term in Medical field. This project will help the end user to check his pulse rate and can also predict the heart attack and other heart diseases.The system will be able to detect the Facial Emotions and also the pulse rate of the user in real time which can be helpful in detecting the heart related diseases without any interaction i.e by just sitting in front of a webcam. A GUI is also designed to make user interact with this application more conveniently.
